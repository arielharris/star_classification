# Stellar Classification with Multi-Class Models
This project is a comparison of different multi-class classification models on the stellar classification dataset.

## Description
This is a basic python project done in jupyter notebook, done to illustrate how several multi-class calssification models perform. It uses [this data set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17), but is also available in the master branch. This project goes through the steps of data preprocessing and exploratory analysis, then into model selection and tuning, and final model evalutations. For more indepth information on the processes used please the the final writeup and presentation files uploaded. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* jupyter notebook
* python
* pandas
* seaborn
* sklearn
* numpy

### Installing
Both the ipynb file and data file can be found under the master branch.

### Executing program
